# How to optimise modern Forge/Neoforge

Hello, in this short guide I will suggest some mods for Forge/Neoforge to say goodbye forever to the beloved Optifine, there are better alternatives. For older versions, the use of Optifine is still recommended.

> Categorisation of mods: 
P) For performance only 
O) For the same functionality as Optifine 
Q) ~~Some quality of life mods I recommend~~ > Coming soon!

    Some mods may only be available for Forge or Neoforge, not all mods are available in all versions.

Links are missing for now, I will add them shortly, every mod is available at **modrinth.com**.
